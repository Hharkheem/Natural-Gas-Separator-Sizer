# Natural-Gas-Separator-Sizer
A comprehensive GUI application for sizing various types of separators used in the oil and gas industry. This tool implements industry-standard calculation methods to help engineers design efficient separators for different process requirements.

# Features
  ðŸ§ª Four Separator Types:
    * 3-Phase Vertical Separator
    * 2-Phase Vertical Separator
    * 3-Phase Horizontal Separator
    * 2-Phase Horizontal Separator
  
  ðŸ“Š Detailed Input Sections:
    * Gas properties (flow rate, density, viscosity)
    * Liquid properties (light and heavy liquid properties)
    * Design parameters (holdup time, surge time, K-factor method)
  
  ðŸ“ˆ Accurate Calculations:
    * Implements GPSA and Otto H. York methods for K-factor calculation
    * Terminal velocity and vapor flow calculations
    * Vessel diameter and length calculations
    * Holdup and surge volume calculations
  
  ðŸš€ User-Friendly Interface:
    * Tab-based organization for different separator types
    * Example values for quick testing
    * Reset buttons to clear inputs
    * Detailed results display
